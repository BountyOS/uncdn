# uncdn

**uncdn** is a simple, CLI-based Python tool that filters out IP addresses belonging to known CDN (Content Delivery Network) and WAF (Web Application Firewall) providers. It supports both plain IP lists and mixed outputs (like MassDNS or DNS scan results), and can be extended with custom CIDR lists or public IP feed URLs.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Filters out IPs that belong to Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly, GCore, and more
- 🧠 Understands both plain IPs and embedded IPs (e.g. from MassDNS output)
- 📥 Automatically downloads CIDR lists from known or custom sources
- 🧩 Supports custom CIDR files and endpoints
- 🗃️ Reads from all `*-cidrs.txt` files inside the `cidr-db/` folder
- ⚡ Fast filtering using native Python libraries
